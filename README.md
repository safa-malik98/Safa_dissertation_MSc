# Predicting the Impact of Comorbidities on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) and Mortality in Hospitalised COVID-19 Patients

## Overview
This project aims to predict the impact of demographics and comorbidities on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) and mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. 
The analysis is based on the ISARIC COVID-19 database, with a focus on 280,477 patients after filtering. 
The project includes univariable analysis, supervised learning models, and survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models).


## Structure
The code is organized by sections of the report:
- **R Code**: Focuses on plotting figures and survival analysis, such as Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.
- **Python Code**: Covers data preparation, logistic regression, machine learning methods, and generating pie charts.

### R Code Sections:
- **Section 3**: Plotting figures - visualising data trends and distributions.
- **Section 4**: Plotting feature importances for Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost and Histogram Gradient Boosting.
- **Section 5**: Cumulative incidence curves, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.

### Python Code Sections:
- **Section 3**: Data preparation, generating pie charts (Figure 4b-f, Figure 9) and univariable logistic regression.
- **Section 4**: Supervised machine learning models for prediction.
